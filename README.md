# Team Profile Generator

Developer: Steven Schmidt

# Overview
A CLI application that generates an HTML file based on user inputs for a team profile webpage. [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) is used to prompt the user. 
Users input a manager/team leader's information, and can enter any number of engineers or interns on that team. Entered employees are placed on an HTML
page as card elements. [Jest Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) was used for testing.

# Demo
